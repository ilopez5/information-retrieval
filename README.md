# Information Retrieval

### Background
I am making this repository public for several reasons. Having taken this course in 
the spring of 2019, I was fairly new to Python and Computer Science as a whole.
Learning about Information Retrieval, and even implementing a
few of them, turned out to be a challenging but fond experience. **Parts of the
codebase are not functional or did not fully meet the assignment requirements**
Of the four assignments, my favorite was implementing PageRank.

### A Message to Current Students
I must suggest you only use my code for ideas, much of it was implementation-specific
and will likely not help you much. Should you copy any, you are doing yourself
a disservice by not struggling through the challenges yourself. Besides, you can
probably do better.
